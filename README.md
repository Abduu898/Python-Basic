# python-basic

This repo is where I’m learning Python step by step. It includes basic exercises, small projects, and code examples as I go through the course.

## 📚 What’s inside

- Variables and data types  
- If/else conditions  
- Loops  
- Functions  
- String manipulation  
- Simple encryption project (like the one in `main.py`)

## 🚀 Why I made this

I’m learning Python and wanted a place to keep track of my progress. This is mostly for practice, but maybe it’ll help someone else too.

## 🛠️ How to run

Make sure you have Python installed. Then just run any file like this:

```bash
python main.py
